                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my summer internship at PNC, I completed a capstone project with 
                        other interns to answer the design prompt: how might we create an experience 
                        giving access to short term funds to students, so they can learn financial 
                        responsibility and establish credit history? I contributed as a designer on 
                        the team. We had 8 weeks to research, design, and pitch our speculative ideas 
                        to the digital team.  
                    </p>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <h5>The mobile banking app currently does not offer a short-term lending 
                        experience tailored towards students.</h5> <br>
                    <p>
                        <b>Solution:</b> RoundUp Repayment mobile app experience tailored towards 
                        student lending and repayment.

                    <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
                    <p>
                        To better understand the problem space, we performed a competitive 
                        analysis of the market for student finance management. We noticed the following trends:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal finance apps like Qapital provide easy platforms for users to gamify and track their spending behavior</li>
                        <li>Round up tools like Bank of American’s Keep the Change Program allow users to put aside their spare change towards a savings account</li>
                        <li>Gap: none of these are integrated within a banking app or specifically target the needs of students. <b>We found an opportunity to leverage finance 
                            tracking and the round up feature towards student loans</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Need Finding Survey</h5>
                    <p>
                        We conducted a survey to better understand the financial backgrounds and needs of students. We received responses from 26 college-age participants through UserZoom. We found that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>many students have a high familiarity with budgets</li>
                            <li>student check their balance infrequently, a majority less than once a month</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h5>Second Survey Insights</h5>
                    <p>
                        Through a second survey, we wanted a more in-depth understanding of students’ relationships with personal finance. There were 50 college-age participants. Key insights included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interest rates are confusing, especially relating to different types of student loans </li>
                            <li>90% of respondents receive some sort of financial assistance from either a loan or a scholarship </li>
                            <li>Financial responsibilities vary based on parental support and other assistance </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h5>Personas</h5>
                    <p>
                        With these research insights, we created three personas based off the data to characterize our 
                        target user groups. Through these personas, we identified differenet categories of students who have 
                        varying levels of financial indepence and needs depending on their financial situation. 
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>We conducted user testing on our initial prototypes with 7 participants. Feedback we received included that the app was:<br>

                        <br><b>Easy to use</b>: participants were easily able to identify and understand the content and its interactions<br>

                        <p>“The app is very user-friendly, easy to use, very modern and minimalistic. It makes me confident that I can successfully manage my student payments.”<br><br>
                            “If I had something like this for my loans, I would have a much easier time paying them down.”

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Get feedback early and often</b>  because the sooner we got users and new perspectives on our work, the sooner we were able to pivot towards more effective design solutions to meet their needs</li>
                        <li><b>Empathize with users</b>  and conduct background research to inform designs that aim to help users reach their goals</li>
                        <li><b>Learning time management</b>  since we had to hold ourselves accountable for deliverables. This was an open-ended prompt and we had to ensure we could deliver a prototype and successfully pitch our ideas during our final presentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h5>In the future, I would...</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include personalized features on the app, such as a rewards system or university sponsorships</li>
                        <li>Integrate more gamification to further engage users and incentivize students to continue using the app</li>
                    </ul>
