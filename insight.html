                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        ClassInsight is a project based on classroom-sensors to perform real-time 
                        data analysis on nonverbal behaviors. This technology collects anonymized data 
                        on location, body position, and gaze distribution over time. The goal is to <b>help 
                        teachers make informed decisions about how to improve their teaching practices.</b> 
                        This was an ongoing project within the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU. 
                        I joined after initial classroom data was collected, and first round user interviews 
                        were conducted.  My role was to interpret, analyze, and visualize this data through a 
                        dashboard design. <br>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <h5>How might we visualize classroom data collected from ClassInsight sensors to 
                        encourage meaningful reflection and action from instructors?
                    </h5> <br>
                    <p>
                        Solution: Our team created a dashboard prototype to promote sense-making and teacher 
                        efficacy, or their confidence in their ability to guide students towards successful 
                        engagement and learning.

                    <p>
                        We performed thematic analysis of user interviews conducted during the initial pilot study. 
                        In the studies, instructors gave their <b>reactions to their nonverbal behavior data and recommended 
                        benchmarks from a classroom session</b>. However, some teachers were resistant to change and felt certain 
                        behaviors were out of their control. <br><br>

                        They were shown data such as their location distribution as well as where their gaze moved over time 
                        during a class session. Participants were made up of teaching instructors, tenured faculty, and teaching 
                        assistants at Carnegie Mellon. 
                        We coded about <b>25 interviews and generated codes</b> based on recurring topics that surfaced instructors’ 
                        responses.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Useful to have a benchmark, what’s realistic, guide goal setting</li>
                        <li>Prefer comparison to own data, different contexts/situations</li>

                        <li>Are other instructors’ averages a good metric</li>
                        <li>Precision of the data, numerical vs qualitative goals</li>
                        <li>Most advice was based on previous experience, but what do new instructors do?</li>

                    <h5>Dashboard Visualizations</h5>
                    <p>Based off these interview insights, we created a series of dashboard visualizations for 
                        a prototype to further test with teachers and get feedback.
                        Our goal was to <b>present the information in a motivating and understandable way</b>. We 
                        incorporated features to encourage teachers to improve their teaching behaviors, such 
                        as the ability to set benchmarks as well as progress tracking over time.

                        We were able to get a better understanding of what it is teachers are really looking 
                        for to get effective feedback.

                    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>You are not your user</b>, although our research team was familiar with 
                            terminology we were using in our studies such as immediacy, location diversity, 
                            gaze balance, to users we were testing with these words had unclear or different 
                            meanings to each person. It’s important to consider designs not from our own 
                            perspective but be able to get outside opinions from our actual users. 
                            It would be helpful to use more everyday language on the dashboard to label data. 
                            (definition of the measures were unclear)
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Consider everything as intentional</b>, designs, although there was no meaning behind the 
                            order the graphs were presented, users often assumed that teacher data was correlated to 
                            the student data graph below
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a more intuitive dashboard with emphasis on data of most interest supported by the user interviews.</li>
                        <li>Add features to focus on the “big picture” measurements to help teachers identify patterns.</li>
