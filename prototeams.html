                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my research internship at the Design Lab, I designed for Prototeams, 
                        a webapp facilitating small group interactions. Often in large settings such as classrooms 
                        or hackathons, <b>it can be difficult and intimidating to find teammates</b>. 
                        I worked with two developers to refine the app interface. 
                        This was an ongoing project, and I joined in the middle of development to build on designs.
                        <br><br>
                        Read more about our work in our CSCW research publication <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3311957.3359505">here</a>.

                    <br><hr><br>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <h5>How can we facilitate team formation in a large crowd?</h5>
                    <p> Solution: ProtoTeams is a system designed to help people meet potential teammates through a 
                        series of short, small group activities. ProtoTeams eases the process of finding teams by 
                        helping users meet potential members and "prototype" teams before choosing members to work with. 
                    </p>

                    <br><hr><br>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        ProtoTeams is divided into 3 components: <b>a participant mobile interface, 
                        a shared display, and a host dashboard</b>. The shared display is displayed or 
                        projected on a large screen and is controlled by the host. Each session has a 
                        certain number of rounds, each containing a number of activities, Sessions can be 
                        customized (group size, number of rounds, types of activities) by the host through 
                        the dashboard.
                    </p>

                    <h5>User Testing</h5><br>
                    <p>We tested the new implementation in an undergraduate project-based design course 
                        at UCSD where students needed to find teammates for a quarter-long project. We 
                        conducted three pilot studies with the new tool during the first few weeks of class. 
                        Quantitative data (timing, member ratings) was collected through the app, and 
                        qualitative data (feedback, impressions) was collected through a post-session survey 
                        and user interviews

                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased time for group activities</li>
                        <li>Updated shape icons to appear more vibrant and with distinctive colors</li>
                        <li>Added transition screen when it is time to leave group</li>

                    <p>
                        An issue that arose was trying to find a method for confirming group members had 
                        physically located each other. Previously, individuals could simply press a button 
                        to confirm their team was found, regardless if this was true or not. We considered 
                        various methods and eventually devided to assign each member an individual number 
                        of oranges and require the group sum to be entered as a means to ensure everyone 
                        was located.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>User testing is important.</b> Testing in real classrooms was a very different experience than testing within our lab. New problems arose within lecture halls such as space arrangements and crowding.</li>
                        <li><b>Design is a lot of problem solving.</b> I realized it’s important to get creative and be open to various possibilities when exploring visual solutions</li>
                        <li><b>Iterate! </b>There’s always new features to be improved upon and having consistent iterations and sources of feedback really helped this project evolve.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h5>In the future, I would...</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design the teacher dashboard to customize their own sessions to choose activites and number of rounds</li>
                        <li>Create a smoother onboarding process, so new instructors can easily facilitate their own sessions through the app</li>
