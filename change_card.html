                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        This past summer, I worked as a UX design intern on the debit card 
                        servicing team at PNC. My core project during this 10 week internship 
                        focused on redesigning the step-by-step wizard screens for users to 
                        request a new card design on the online banking site. Throughout this 
                        internship, I collaborated with developers and project managers to 
                        assess design requirements. Due to NDA, most of the final work is 
                        under wraps, but I would love to share my process behind the work.

                    <h5>Journey Map</h5>
                    <p>
                        I began by creating a user journey map to understand the current 
                        experience of requesting a new card design. My goal was to empathize 
                        with users and identify their goals and potential frustrations at each 
                        step. Users ultimately want to view relevant design options and easily 
                        customize their card.

                    <p>
                        I focused on some key pain points in this process that could be improved 
                        in the redesign. From a user perspective, these elements made the experience 
                        more complicated and less intuitive.

                    <p>
                        After initial research, I presented these findings in a group design session 
                        to identify areas of opportunity to address these points of frustration. We 
                        looked at the bank’s mobile experience as well as competitor banking sites to 
                        gather ideas for features. In the end, we came up with several design solutions, 
                        which I incorporated in a new user journey map.

                        After our brainstorming session, I got to work creating lo-fidelity 
                        wireframes incorporating initial ideas for the change card design 
                        flow. I wanted to create screens that made each step visually clear 
                        and simple while still communicating necessary information.

                    <h5>How to design the card selection screen?</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Displaying so many card choices</b></p>
                    <p>One of the biggest challenges was determining how to organize and display 
                        all these cards within a single screen. There are over 40 different designs, 
                        and they can’t all fit on a single page. Especially for responsive screens, it 
                        would be a nightmare to scroll through a single column of all these cards. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Following a Design System</b></p>
                    <p>Staying consistent within the company’s design patterns was another big priority, 
                        so I had to ensure that if there was a ‘Next’ button, it would be located at the 
                        bottom similar to other card action flows.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>I considered the following options...</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Incremental ‘Load More’</li>
                        <li>Internal scrollbar</li>
                        <li>Modal pop-up</li>
                        <li>Card as a ‘Next’ button (chosen solution)</li>

                    <h5>Final Solution</h5>
                    <p>
                        In the end, I decided to have each card funtion as a ‘Next’ button directly taking 
                        users to the next step. So, clicking a card automatically leads to the next step with 
                        that design selected. This approach had the following benefits:

                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Familiar interaction</b></p>
                    <p>This direct selection is similar to online shopping experiences, where you browse through 
                        options before clicking one to be taken to a new detail page. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Reduced clicks</b></p>
                    <p>Don’t have to scroll down to or click an extra ‘Next’ button to continue. The card selection 
                        component was also not yet developed in the design system, but this was no longer necessary 
                        if the selected state was not visible.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Accessible and flexible</b></p>
                    <p>Reduces confusion since the Card Benefits link for Sports cards were an unexpected pause in 
                        screen readers when implemented as radio buttons. It also allows for category subheadings.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>The importance of communication</b> within a cross-functional team. This was my first time designing 
                            in an industry setting, and a big part of my work was learning to clearly present design solutions 
                            and advocate for my decisions. I realized communicating my thought process
                            was just as important as the design work itself.</li>
                        <li><b>Working in an agile environment</b> and being open to new solutions and design directions along the way. 
                            During each sprint, I met with stakeholders to get continuous insights into areas like development and 
                            business interests that guided iterations.</li>
                        <li><b>Knowing what to prioritize</b> to deliver a minimum viable product. We were working within a timeline, so I had 
                            to decide the most important features and focus on providing the greatest value given available resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h5>In the future, I would...</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Explore ways to integrate card benefits</b> information within the wizard rather than on an external page link. 
                            This would help users stay within the experience and provide cleaner information flow.</li>
                        <li><b>Conduct user-testing</b> to see how quickly and intuitively users are able to select a card and proceed throught the wizard steps.</li>
                        <li><b>Create mobile wireframes</b>, so users can conveniently access responsive pages on their phones.</li>
